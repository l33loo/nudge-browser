# Nudge

Nudge is a mobile and browser app that notifies emergency contacts by email when it stops registering either movement on the user's cellphone via the mobile app, or activity on the browser version of the app. The current repo contains the code for the browser app (front-end).

The browser app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and is deployed with Heroku [here](https://nudge-client-app.herokuapp.com).

This was a final project for Lighthouse Labs' Web Development Bootcamp, Victoria (BC) cohort of may 2018.

## Contributions

## Features

1. Users can login with a Google account
2. Logged-in users can add emergency contacts
3. Logged-in users can enable/disable email notifications sent to their contacts after 24 hours of inactivity on the app (on the browser app, activity is registered as mouse and keyboard events on the app; on the mobile app, activity is registered via phone movement)
4. Logged-in users can view when was the last time that the app registered their activity
